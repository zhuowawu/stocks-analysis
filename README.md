# stocks-analysis
Repository for module 2

## Overview of Project
In this project, we used VBA to analyze a spreadsheet containing stock information.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice multiple features of VBA and to compare refactoring code with less structured code.  

## Results
The analysis of the spreadsheet was done with the following VBA code:

Our results for year 2017 and year 2018 are as follows:

From the screenshots, we could tell that the stock market in 2017 was much healthier than the stock market in 2018, as there were much higher profits with only one stock yielding negative profits. In 2018, most stocks caused loss in profits.

The time needed to analyze the spreadsheet for 2017 was slightly longer than the time needed to analyze the spreadsheet for 2018.


## Summary

### advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
One advantage of the refactored code is that the time needed to analyze the sheets is significantly shorter, which is beneficial when a large amount of data needs to be analyzed. Another advantage of refactoring code is that the structure is more stable and less like to break. One disadvantage is that one needs to be extra careful when writing the code as it involves more elements in the structure.

### 
In our VBA project, the processing time is cut down significantly from around 0.8 seconds (before formatting) to 0.2 seconds (with formatting) after refactoring, which shows one of the most important advantages of refactoring code. However, the code took longer to refine and debug as more elements were involved in the code.
